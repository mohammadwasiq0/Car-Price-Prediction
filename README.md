This project is based on Linear Regression.

In this projetct I predict the **selling price** of car.

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more.

### Accuracy Using Linear Regression
The Accuracy Using Linear Regression is about $88.5\%$ 

i.e. The value of $R^2=88.5$

### Accuracy Using Lasso Regression
The Accuracy Using Lasso Regression is about $88.6\%$

i.e. The value of $R^2=88.6$

### Accuracy Using Ridge Regression
The Accuracy Using Ridge Regression is about $88.6\%$

i.e. The value of $R^2=88.6$
